- Logging of all turns (questions, answers, eliminations, moderator)

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** HTML + JavaScript (Bootstrap for layout)  
- **Backend:** Flask (Python 3.10+)  
- **Storage:** sqlite3
- **Deployment:** Local (MVP), online hosting later
- **Audio:** WebRTC later  

## üöÄ How to Run/Test

### 1. Setup Environment

### 4. Test Game Flow
1. **Player 2**: Ask a question like "Is this character blonde?"
2. **Player 1**: Click "Yes" or "No" 
3. **Player 2**: Eliminate cards based on the answer
4. **Moderator**: Add research notes as needed


## SQLite database logging

The application persists game transcript to a SQLite database at `db/games.db`. Tables are:
- `games` ‚Äî game rows (game id, chosen card, created_at)
- `events` ‚Äî timestamped actions (role, action, text, card, ...)
- `eliminated_cards` ‚Äî per-game eliminated card entries with timestamps

Quick sqlite3 commands to inspect the database:

Open the DB interactively:
```bash
sqlite3 db/games.db
```
Show tables and schema:
```sql
.tables
.schema events
```
Pretty output examples:
```bash
# Last 50 events
sqlite3 -header -column db/games.db "SELECT * FROM events ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 50;"

# All chat messages for game 'default'
sqlite3 -header -column db/games.db "SELECT timestamp, role, text FROM events WHERE game_id='default' AND action='chat' ORDER BY timestamp;"

```
