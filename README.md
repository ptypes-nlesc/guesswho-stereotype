A research web-application version of the “Guess Who?” game used to study how players express stereotypes indirectly — here through character elimination rather than explicit discussion.

## 🚀 How to Run / Test

### 1️⃣ Set up environment
```bash
# Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # (Windows: venv\Scripts\activate)

# Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2️⃣ Start the server
```bash
python app.py
```
### 3️⃣ Create and Join a Game Session
Each game has its own unique game_id generated by the backend.

1. Open  
```
http://127.0.0.1:5000/moderator
```

2. Click 'New Game' button 
   → the app calls `/create_game` and reloads both player iframes with the new `game_id`.

Then open the three views manually (replace <game_id> with your own):

Player 1: 
```
http://127.0.0.1:5000/player1?game_id=<game_id>
```

Player 2: 
```
http://127.0.0.1:5000/player2?game_id=<game_id>
```

Moderator: 
```
http://127.0.0.1:5000/moderator?game_id=<game_id>
```
